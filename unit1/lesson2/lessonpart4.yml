title: Dot Product
content: >
  ## Introduction


  In this lesson, we will learn about the matrix dot product, a fundamental
  operation in linear algebra. Understanding the dot product is essential for
  various applications in mathematics, physics, and computer science.


  ## Definition of Matrix Dot Product


  The dot product (also known as the scalar product) of two matrices is a way to
  multiply two matrices to produce a single number. It is calculated by
  multiplying corresponding elements of the matrices and then summing the
  results.


  ## Mathematical Explanation


  Given two matrices `A`* *and `B`* *of the **same size**, the dot product is
  calculated as follows:


  `A = [ a1, a2 ][ a3, a4 ]`,`B = [ b1, b2][ b3, b4 ]`


  The dot product of A* *and B* *is:


  &#x20;` A ⋅ B = (a1 ⋅ b1)  + (a2 ⋅ b2)  + (a3 ⋅ b3)  + (a4 ⋅ b4)`


  ## Python Implementation


  Let's implement the matrix dot product in Python without using any libraries.
  We'll use basic Python syntax to achieve this.


  ```

  # Function to calculate the dot product of two matrices

  def matrix_dot_product(matrix1, matrix2):
      # Ensure the matrices are of the same size
      if len(matrix1) != len(matrix2) or len(matrix1) != len(matrix2):
          raise ValueError("Matrices must be of the same size")
      
      # Initialize the dot product result
      dot_product = 0
      
      # Iterate through the matrices and calculate the dot product
      for i in range(len(matrix1)):
          for j in range(len(matrix1[0])):
              dot_product += matrix1[i][j] * matrix2[i][j]
      
      return dot_product

  # Example matrices

  matrix1 = [
      [1, 2],
      [3, 4]
  ]


  matrix2 = [
      [5, 6],
      [7, 8]
  ]


  # Calculate the dot product

  result = matrix_dot_product(matrix1, matrix2)

  print("The dot product of the matrices is:", result)


  ```


  ## Examples


  Let's go through an example to understand how the dot product is calculated.


  Given the matrices:


  `A = [ 1, 2 ][ 3, 4 ]`,`B = [ 5, 6 ][ 7, 8 ]`


  The dot product is calculated as:


  `(1⋅5) + (2⋅6) + (3⋅7) + (4⋅8) = 5 + 12 + 21 + 32 = 70`


  So, the dot product of matrices `A`* *and `B`** is 70.

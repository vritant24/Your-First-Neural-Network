  ## Introduction


  Exponentials are a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in algebra.
  They are used to represent repeated multiplication of a number by itself. In
  this lesson, we will learn what exponentials are and how to work with them
  using Python.


  ## What is an Exponential?


  An exponential is a mathematical expression that represents repeated
  multiplication of the same factor. It is written in the form: a^n


  Where:


  * *a* is the base

  * *n* is the exponent


  For example, 2^3 means 2×2×2, which equals 8.


  ## Using Python to Calculate Exponentials


  Python provides a simple way to calculate exponentials using the `**` operator
  or the `pow()` function.


  ### Example 1: Using the `**` Operator


  ```

  # Calculate 2^3 using the ** operator

  result = 2 ** 3

  print(result)  # Output: 8


  ```


  ### Example 2: Using the `pow()` Function


  ```

  # Calculate 2^3 using the pow() function

  result = pow(2, 3)

  print(result)  # Output: 8


  ```


  ## Practice Problems


  1. Calculate 3^4

  2. Calculate 5^2

  3. Calculate 10^0

  4. Calculate 2^(−3)

  ## What is an Array?


  An array is a collection of items. The idea is to store multiple items of the
  same type together.


  ## Why Use Arrays?


  Arrays are useful because they allow you to store multiple values in a single
  variable, which can be more efficient and easier to manage than using separate
  variables for each value. They are particularly useful when you need to
  perform the same operation on multiple values, such as iterating through a
  list of numbers to find the sum.


  ## Creating Arrays in Python


  In Python, arrays can be created using lists. Here, we will focus on using
  lists, which are more commonly used in Python.


  ```

  # Creating an array (list) in Python

  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  print(numbers)


  ```


  ## Accessing Array Elements


  You can access elements in an array by their index. In Python, indexing starts
  at 0, which means the first element is at index 0, the second element is at
  index 1, and so on.


  ```

  # Accessing elements in an array

  first_element = numbers[0]

  second_element = numbers[1]

  print("First element:", first_element)

  print("Second element:", second_element)


  ```


  ## Modifying Array Elements


  You can also modify elements in an array by assigning a new value to a
  specific index.


  ```

  # Modifying elements in an array

  numbers[0] = 10

  numbers[1] = 20

  print(numbers)


  ```

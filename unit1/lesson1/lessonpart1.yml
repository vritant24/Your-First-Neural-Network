title: What is a Neural Network?
content: >
  ## Introduction


  A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to
  mimic the way the human brain works. Just like our brains use neurons to
  process information, neural networks use artificial neurons to perform tasks
  such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from data.


  ## Basic Structure


  A neural network is made up of layers of artificial neurons. These layers
  include:


  * **Input Layer**: This is where the network receives information. Each neuron
  in this layer represents a feature or piece of data.

  * **Hidden Layers**: These layers process the information received from the
  input layer. There can be multiple hidden layers, each performing different
  transformations on the data.

  * **Output Layer**: This layer produces the final result or prediction based
  on the processed information.

  ## How It Works


  Neural networks learn by adjusting the connections between neurons, known as
  weights. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:


  1. **Initialization**: The network starts with random weights.

  2. **Forward Propagation**: Data is passed through the network, layer by
  layer, until it reaches the output layer.

  3. **Loss Calculation**: The network's prediction is compared to the actual
  result, and a loss (or error) is calculated.

  4. **Backward Propagation**: The network adjusts the weights to minimize the
  loss. This process is repeated many times, allowing the network to learn and
  improve its predictions.


  ## Applications


  Neural networks are used in a variety of applications, including:


  * **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects in photos and videos.

  * **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.

  * **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human
  language.

  * **Game Playing**: Teaching computers to play games like chess and Go.

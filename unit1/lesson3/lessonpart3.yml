title: Add a Sigmoid Derivative function
content: >
  ### What is a Sigmoid Derivative?


  The sigmoid derivative is a special function that helps us understand how the
  sigmoid function changes. Think of it as a way to measure how steep or flat
  the sigmoid curve is at any point.


  Imagine you are riding a bike up and down hills. The sigmoid function is like
  the path you are riding on, and the sigmoid derivative tells you how steep the
  hill is at any point. If the hill is steep, you need to pedal harder (adjust
  the weights more). If the hill is flat, you don't need to pedal as hard
  (adjust the weights less).


  ### Why Do We Need It?


  When we train a neural network, we need to adjust the weights to make better
  predictions. The sigmoid derivative helps us figure out how much to adjust
  these weights. It's like a guide that tells us how confident we are about the
  current weights.


  ### How Does It Work?


  **Sigmoid Function**: First, remember that the sigmoid function squishes any
  number into a value between 0 and 1.


  **Derivative**: The derivative of the sigmoid function tells us how much the
  output value changes when we change the input value a little bit.


  ### Formula


  The formula for the sigmoid derivative is:


  ```

  sigmoid_derivative(x) = sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

  ```




  ## Time to code


  Add the following method to your class


  ```

  def __sigmoid_derivative(self, x):
      return x * (1 - x)
  ```


  Over here, we'll expect `x` to be the calculation result of
  `__sigmoid(x)` (the method we added before).

title: Add a Sigmoid Function
content: >
  ### What is a Sigmoid Function?


  The sigmoid function is a special mathematical function that helps us in
  machine learning, especially in neural networks. Think of it as a way to
  squish any number into a range between 0 and 1.


  Imagine you have a magic box that takes any number and gives you a value
  between 0 and 1. If you put in a big number, the box gives you a value close
  to 1. If you put in a small number, the box gives you a value close to 0. This
  magic box is like the sigmoid function!


  ### How Does It Work?


  The sigmoid function takes any number (positive or negative) and transforms it
  into a value between 0 and 1. Here's the formula:


  ```

  sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))

  ```


  But don't worry about the formula too much. Just remember that it turns big
  numbers into values close to 1 and small numbers into values close to 0.


  ### Why Do We Use It?


  **Range**: The sigmoid function makes sure that the output is always between 0
  and 1. This is useful when we want to predict probabilities, like the chance
  of rain tomorrow.


  **Smooth Curve**: The sigmoid function creates a smooth S-shaped curve. This
  helps the neural network learn and make better predictions.


  **Adjusting Weights**: The sigmoid function's curve helps us adjust the
  weights in the neural network during training. This means the network can
  learn from its mistakes and improve over time.

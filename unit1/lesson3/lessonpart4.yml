title: Add a dot product method
content: >
  ## Time to code


  We've already learnt what a dot product is, so let's get to coding straight
  away!


  let's define the `dot` method inside the `NeuralNetwork` class. This method
  will take two matrices (lists of lists) as input and return their dot product.


  ```

  def dot(self, a, b):
      # Ensure the matrices can be multiplied
      if len(a) != len(b):
          raise ValueError("Matrices cannot be multiplied")

      # Initialize the result matrix with zeros
      result = [[0 for _ in range(len(b))] for _ in range(len(a))]

      # Perform matrix multiplication
      for i in range(len(a)):
          for j in range(len(b)):
              for k in range(len(b)):
                  result[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]

      return result
  ```
